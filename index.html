    <h1>Privacy Policy for Capy Voice</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 12, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Capy Voice ("we," "our," or "us") is an application developed by an individual developer. We respect your privacy and design our app to be privacy-first. <strong>We do not operate any servers, and we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data, audio recordings, or transcripts.</strong> All data processing happens either locally on your device or directly between your device and the third-party AI providers you authorize.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Usage</h2>
    <h3>2.1 No Proprietary Data Collection</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not have access to your microphone data, API keys, or text transcripts.</li>
        <li>The App runs entirely client-side on your macOS device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Audio Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone Usage:</strong> We access your microphone only when you explicitly trigger the recording feature (e.g., via hotkey).</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If "Native Speech Engine" is enabled, audio is processed on your device by Apple's Speech Recognition service.</li>
                <li>If "OpenAI Whisper" is enabled, audio data is sent to OpenAI's API for transcription.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Text Data & AI Interaction</h3>
    <p>When you use the "AI Response" or "Improve Grammar" features, the transcribed text and any prompts you provide are sent to Google's Gemini API (Generative AI) for processing.</p>

    <h3>2.4 API Keys</h3>
    <p>Your API keys (OpenAI, Google Gemini) are stored locally on your device in the <strong>Secure Keychain</strong>. We do not have access to your keys, and they are sent directly from your device to the respective third-party providers.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services to provide the App's core functionality. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> <a href="https://openai.com/privacy">https://openai.com/privacy</a> (Used for Whisper transcription)</li>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a> (Used for AI intelligence)</li>
        <li><strong>Apple:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a> (Used for Native Dictation)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Capy Voice App:</strong> Since we do not operate a server, it is physically impossible for us to retain your data. Audio recordings and transcripts are processed transiently in memory and are discarded immediately after use.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Parties:</strong> Third-party providers (OpenAI, Google) may retain API data in accordance with their own data retention policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the App and entering your API keys, you consent to the transmission of your audio and text data to these third-party services for the purpose of fulfilling your requests.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer.</p>
